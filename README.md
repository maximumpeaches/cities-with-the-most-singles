The CSV files in this directory were downloaded from a free website that contains the data for the American Community Survey. You can find the data if you go to data.census.gov and search for the "marital status" table.
The python file operates on the CSV files and outputs the ratio of males to females in various cities. In addition to the ratio of unmarried men to women you might consider the absolute number of available men or available women in a city.

Also the marital status table can be accessed either organized by "place" which often is a particular city, or by "statistical area". "Place" might be Washington DC, whereas "statistical area" might include all of Washington DC, Arlington and Alexandria.
